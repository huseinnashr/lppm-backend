## I. What is this?

I made this practice project to try to adopt latest technologies and practices as a backend engineers. I started with past experiences and had in mind about what to avoid and what to do. Along the journey I‚Äôve discovered more about techs, practices and tradeoffs that have to be made in the whole software lifecycle. There‚Äôs a few thing that I haven‚Äôt implemented but I‚Äôve decided to move on to another project (see : What I wanna do next)

## II. What does it cover

### II.A. Test driven development

In this project, I wrote the integration test, and then developed the code afterwards. I mainly did this because I could test code changes across all specification automatically rather than manually checking them, e.g. with cURL. I used jest and superagent for the the test, and codecov to see the test coverage.

### II.B. Integrating GitHub with CircleCI and Codecov

I did this just to try things out. The way I configured it was everytime I push changes to github, CircleCI will automatically run test and send the coverage to codecov. Both CircleCI and Codecov than return all results back to Github. On Github, I could specify that only successfully tested code can be merge, but I didn‚Äôt, since I pushed code directly to master branch anyway üôà

### II.C. HATEOAS API (sort of).

I‚Äôve made API‚Äôs before, and I‚Äôve learned that you need to include app state in your response. If you don‚Äôt than you‚Äôll need to copy the business logic to frontend, which is bad. the responses. Through the project, I discovered that what I was trying to achieve is called Hateoas. Although I implemented it is a little bit different. I used states instead of links because I didn‚Äôt know Hateoas at that time

## III. Repo Files

- ./lppm.sql : contain sql for table creation and mock data for test
- ./index.js : where the app starts
- ./test/\* : contain all the integration test
- ./controllers/\* : contain all code that talk to database and do business logic
- ./artifacts/\* : contain development documents

## IV. How to run

1. Clone this repo.
2. run ‚Äúnpm install‚Äù
3. Add the following environment variables to your system
   MYSQL_USER, MYSQL_PASSWORD, MYSQL_DATABASE (database name),
4. Sign up to CircleCI and Codecov with GitHub, these 3rd party tools will detect and do their work when you push your changes to GitHub

## V. What this is not

Full Requirement gathering and system design: In this project I only document the usecase, database design, some business process. For the requirement, I just wrote it as integration test.

## VI. What I want to do next

### VI.A. Proper Hateoas API in laravel

Through the project, I discovered that it really hard to make good Hateoas backend without of the shelf frameworks. Sadly, NodeJS doesn‚Äôt have any framework that has features and ease of development as laravel. But NodeJS maybe great if you aren‚Äôt building CRUD heavy system. So I planned to make Hateoas in laravel next.

### VI.B. Scaling out ACID database and backend

I wanted to try Replication, Sharding and other mechanism on database, duplicating backend, load balancer with session and other things to scale out the system. I wanted to do this because I‚Äôve seen so many systems that can‚Äôt handle the load.

### VI.C. API Documentation and other development artifact
